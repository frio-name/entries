## Open Source ALL THE THINGS

Too often, I start things and don't finish them.  I rewrite entries for this blog 5 or 6 times, never committing them to the repository; never actually releasing them.  I create sweeping projects, littering my various src/ directories; again, never letting them see the light of day.

A big part of the reason for this is the conflation of one's work with one's ego.  As a recent [blog post][1] reminded me, it's OK to suck.  Even if you've done something for a long time; even if you're supposed to be *good* at it... it's OK to suck.

In that spirit, I'm committing to open-sourcing everything I work on (outside of my day job!) for the rest of the year.  It'll sit on github, no matter the quality.
